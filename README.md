This is the collection of Android Projects I developed while pursuing the <b>Advanced Android Development Nanodegree</b> program at Udacity. This repository is organised so that each folder is one single Android Project, submited, reviewed, evaluated and passed. List of projects is as follows:
<ul>
	<li>Sandwich Club</li>
	<li>Popular Movies - Part 1</li>
	<li>Popular Movies - Part 2</li>
	<li>Baking App</li>
	<li>Build It Bigger</li>
	<li>XYZ Reader</li>
	<li>Capstone Project - OpenNews</li>
</ul>
This program was scheduled for six months in regular period, I completed it in a month with as a full time student.
Here is a preview of some of the screens in each project. Each project has its own README.md which gives details about that project.
